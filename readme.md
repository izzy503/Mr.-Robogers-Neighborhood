## Description
Create a web application that takes a number from the user and returns a list of values from 0 to the user's inputted number with the following substitutions made within the returned list:

- For numbers that contain a 1, all digits are replaced with "Beep!"
- For numbers that contain a 2, all digits are replaced with "Boop!"
- For numbers that contain a 3, all digits are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

## Instructions
1. Enter a number in the input field.
2. Click the "Generate Output" button to see the list of values with substitutions.

## Implementation Details
- The application uses at least one loop, at least one array, and branching logic to solve the problem.
- The user can input a new number and see new results repeatedly.
- The application returns a list of values as an array with the specified substitutions.

## Example Tests

### Test 1
**Input:** 5
**Expected Output:** [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5]

### Test 2
**Input:** 13
**Expected Output:** [0, "Beep", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!"]

## Business Logic Tests

### Test: "It should return an array of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number"
```javascript
console.log(beepBoop(0)); // Expected Output: [0]
console.log(beepBoop(5)); // Expected Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
